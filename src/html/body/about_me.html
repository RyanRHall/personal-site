    The tech buzzwords I generally associate myself with include:
      <strong>blockchains</strong>,
      <strong>decentralization</strong>,
      <strong>data science & ML</strong>,
      <strong>security</strong>,
      <strong>privacy</strong>, and
      <strong>civics tech</strong>

    I am an engineer, with an eye for product, who wants to address social and political issues. I want to expand the breadth of challenges that technology can help us solve.

    The world of software seems to offer a near limitless bag of challenging problems. I have particularly enjoyed delving into the worlds of blackchains/smart contracts and data science/machine learning. In my explorations, however, I have yet to find harder problems than those in the domain of humanity:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How do we build an internet that favors truth over sensationalism?</li>
    <li>How do we give people ownership of their personal data and enable secure, permissioned sharing?</li>
    <li>How do we build voting systems that are secure, accessible, and auditable?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These are hard problems - really hard problems - and I want to help answer them.
