<h1>A few words about me:</h1>

<div id="about-me-section" class="section">
  <p>
    <strong>I write code.</strong> I am fascinated by
      <strong>blockchains</strong>
      and
      <strong>decentralization</strong>,
      concerned about internet
      <strong>security</strong>
      and personal
      <strong>privacy</strong>,
      and my passions guide me towards
      <strong>civic tech.</strong>

  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I am an engineer with an eye for product, who wants to address <strong>social</strong> and <strong>political</strong> issues. I want to expand the breadth of challenges that technology can help us solve.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>I have a strong background in building <strong>Rails</strong> applications and using modern <strong>JavaScript</strong> libraries like <strong>React</strong>.</p>
