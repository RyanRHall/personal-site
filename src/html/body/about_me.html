<h1>A few words about me:</h1>

<div id="about-me-section" class="section">
  <p>
    The tech buzzwords I generally associate myself with include:
      <strong>blockchains</strong>,
      <strong>decentralization</strong>,
      <strong>security</strong>,
      <strong>privacy</strong>, and
      <strong>civic tech</strong>.

  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I am an engineer, with an eye for product, who wants to address <strong>social</strong> and <strong>political</strong> issues. I want to expand the breadth of challenges that technology can help us solve.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>I have a strong background in building <strong>Rails</strong> applications and using modern <strong>JavaScript</strong> libraries like <strong>React</strong>.</p>
